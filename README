This project is an attempt to fix the csgo branch of the source engine so that it is easier to make a mod on this branch
You can build portal 2 and hl2/ep1/ep2/ep3(partial) currently, but more games may be added

This uses a lot of code from https://github.com/EpicSentry/P2ASW, https://github.com/EpicSentry/HL2-CSGO and P2GO (when it existed)
Thanks (:

To set the project up (Important!):
1. copy the platform folder from csgo to /game
2. copy the csgo/materials/dev folder (it might be in a vpk) from csgo to /game/portal2/materials 
3. Create the vpc and build the project in Release mode
4. Click run.bat
