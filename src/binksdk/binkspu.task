/* @RSNE @MTD
   Bink provides an SPU implementation which is in binkspu.a and binkspu_spurs.a. 
   We just need to link those together - no code necessary here. See bink_spu.bat for gorier details.

// VSI doesn't realise that it needs to relink this task when the libraries
// change.  So as a hack, include bink.h to get this file to recompile.  bink.h
// defines BinkBuildNumber, so it should always get updated with the libraries.
